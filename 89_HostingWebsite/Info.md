Hosting Tutorial- Where To Host your Website?
Till now we have seen various different concepts in web development. In this lecture, we are going to discuss some of the points related to domain and hosting and how to host your website. 

In our starting tutorial, we have seen how a client sends a request from his device to the web server and in return he receives the response from the server. The result will be, the client sees the website he wants to visit as shown here-



For example, if we search for Flipkart.com, the web server will send back all the server files hosted on any server, to the client. For hosting your website, you require a web server and it allows you to host all your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

If you search for hosting on the web, you will see different results that are offering their services to you to host your web files at some cost. From them, if you select any one, you will be provided with an admin panel that allows you to host your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Also you will be provided with a password so that only you can view and manage your web files.

For hosting your files on the web, you require a domain name. A domain name is an identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority or control within the Internet. Domain names are used in various networking contexts and for application-specific naming and addressing purposes. It is something which represents your website. You need to connect your domain with your hosting server through domain name space(DNS). 


Now let us discuss what servers are. A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network. In theory, whenever computers share resources with client machines they are considered servers. There are many types of servers, including web servers, mail servers, and virtual servers.

An individual system can provide resources and use them from another system at the same time. This means that a device could be both a server and a client at the same time.Data centers are simply centralized locations where computing and networking equipment is concentrated for the purpose of collecting, storing, processing, distributing or allowing access to large amounts of data. They have existed in one form or another since the advent of computers. Many companies like GoDaddy or Amazon web services have data centers in different parts of the world. These are all used to store our data in one of such devices as follows-



You will be provided with a VPS(virtual private server) in which your data will be stored. And if some attacks happen on these data servers, then too your data will be saved as they have different back-ups on different locations like Asia, Europe, America, and Japan.

Now it totally depends on the needs of your website which type of server you want. You can select any one of them like Amazon web services, Microsoft Azure, or Google services. You can try on different platforms as they offer free service for certain periods of time and then decide your final choice.
