Although we can install several other operating systems in the server like python, node etc. but our main objective is to host our static website on it.
So, we will be installing Apache2 web server in our server.

UFW is a firewall whose status is inactive now. It means that anyone can configure with our systemâ€™s requirements and hence, we need to activate it.
ufw status

Along with it, we need to install a tried and trusted software. We need to run the command called **apt update ** and we will get the output as follows-

Some more apt commands are as follows-
`apt install apache2`
`apt install mysql-server`
`apt install php`
`apt install python`
`apt install nodejs`
ETC

We will now install the software called lamp stack. A LAMP Stack is a set of open-source software that can be used to create websites and web applications. LAMP is an acronym, and these stacks typically consist of the Linux operating system, the Apache HTTP Server, the MySQL relational database management system, and the PHP programming language.

We now need to write `apt install apache2`. 
Also it is recommended to setup a server by making a new user. We can do this by writing the command- adduser user and giving admin privileges and they just have to use 'sudo' before the command.

Commands in tutorial are as follows-
`ufw status`
`cd /var/www/`
`ls ---> cd html`
`ls ---> index.html`
`vim index.html` (Used to edit the file in the terminal for ubuntu)
{VIM COMMANDS} -->
i ---> insert
esc ---> exit
:wq ---> save and exit
